"""Download the pool datasets from Roboflow Universe (YOLOv11 format) into datasets/raw/<name>/.

Your Roboflow API key is read from the ROBOFLOW_API_KEY environment variable (Roboflow -> Settings ->
API Keys). It is never written to disk or printed. In PowerShell:

    $env:ROBOFLOW_API_KEY = "your_key_here"
    .venv\\Scripts\\python.exe training\\get_datasets.py              # all datasets below
    .venv\\Scripts\\python.exe training\\get_datasets.py university   # just one

Uses only the Python standard library (Roboflow REST export API: ask for an export link, then download
the zip). All three datasets are CC BY 4.0: credit them in the README (see the CREDIT lines printed).
