"""Approaching-object alert for a MOVING (wearable / chest-mounted) camera.

Why a separate rule: on a moving camera every object slides across the image when the wearer
walks, so position-based speed, zones and loitering stop meaning anything. What still works is
LOOMING: an object coming at you gets bigger in the image. If its size is s, then

    growth rate  g = d(ln s)/dt          (per second)
    time to contact  TTC = 1 / g         (seconds, when g > 0)

because the image size of an object is inversely proportional to its distance. Size change is
independent of the camera's sideways motion, so this works while the wearer walks.

An alert fires when an object is (1) growing fast enough that TTC <= `approaching.ttc_s`,
(2) in the wearer's path AT THE MOMENT OF CONTACT (people in the next lane, who drift outward as
you get closer, are not flagged), (3) growing uniformly (width and height together, so raising
arms is not an approach), and (4) already
close enough to matter (its size is a sizeable fraction of the frame height), for at least
`approaching.min_duration_s`.

Pure NumPy (no OpenCV / torch), like the other reasoning modules. See DESIGN.md section 4.11.
