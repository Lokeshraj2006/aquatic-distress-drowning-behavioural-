"""Behaviour rules: loitering, zone intrusion, running, fall, crowding, near miss + the "normal" baseline.

NumPy only. The rules are deliberately simple and explainable: each one is a measurable condition
(distance, time, speed, shape) with thresholds from config.yaml, so every flagged event can be
justified with numbers.

`detect_behaviors` returns RAW intervals (not merged, not duration-filtered for running / zone / fall
/ crowding). events.py merges close pieces, applies the minimum durations and builds the final events.

Three kinds of rule:
  * one object over time ..... loitering, zone intrusion, running, fall
  * a scene-level count ....... crowding (how many objects are inside a zone at the same time)
  * a pair of objects ......... near miss (two objects closed in on each other while moving)
