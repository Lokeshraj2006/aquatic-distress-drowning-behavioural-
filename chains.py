"""Incident chains: rate every event (severity) and link one entity's events into a story.

Pure Python (no OpenCV, no NumPy work). This is where a list of separate events such as

    Person #3 loitering 00:12-00:30   ->   Person #3 inside the zone 00:31-00:36

becomes ONE incident with a title ("Waited nearby, then entered the restricted zone"), a severity
and a plain-English story with the gaps between the steps. See DESIGN.md section 4.1 and 4.8.

Entry point: build_chains(events, cfg) -> list of chain dicts. It also sets event["severity"]
("low" | "medium" | "high") on every event, even when chaining is switched off.
